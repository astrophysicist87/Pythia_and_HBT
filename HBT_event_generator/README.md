This package contains two sets of codes:
   (1) - HBT_event_generator_w_errors
   (2) - fit_correlation_function
Their use is explained below.

(1) - HBT_event_generator_w_errors receives output from Pythia (or equivalent event generator) in a format similar to the standard OSCAR output format.  All options for a given run can be set in the driver.sh script, which runs Pythia and then processes the output from this run.

(2) - fit_correlation_function...umm...fits the correlation function?

(3) - source_variances computes (SV) HBT radii, source variances, and source moments from Pythia output.
